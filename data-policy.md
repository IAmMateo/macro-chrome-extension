We’re use Google Analytics - out of the box without any major customization. To learn more about Google Analytics read this: https://developers.google.com/analytics/resources/concepts/gaConceptsTrackingOverview#howAnalyticsGetsData

We use Google Analytics to track data when users install the Macro Chrome Extension, when users visit our website (https://usemacro.github.io/) or when users visit our page on the Chrome store (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/macro/pgffhcglkcdpalkgpkkghpofcoibodak)
